## GBC library for C++17

Intended for embedded where you have direct access to framebuffers. Your computer needs a way to get a high-precision timestamp and sleep for micros at a time. Delegates will be called async from the virtual machine, and you must call the system calls from there. You can tell the virtual machine about key presses through the API.


The virtual machine does not copy the ROM data unnecessarily, and uses memory conservatively. The instruction decoder is written to reduce instruction count. When building with clang you should enable LTO.
